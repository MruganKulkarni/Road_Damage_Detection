# Project Overview:
This repository contains code and resources for a road damage detection model using YOLOv5. The model is trained to identify potholes and cracks in road images, contributing to infrastructure maintenance and safety efforts.
## Features:
### Pothole and Crack Detection:
 The model is designed to detect and localize potholes and cracks in road images.
### YOLOv5 Implementation: 
The model is implemented using YOLOv5, a state-of-the-art object detection framework.
## Application and Uses:

### Infrastructure Maintenance:
Road Repair Planning: Governments and municipalities can use the model to identify areas with significant road damage, helping prioritize and plan road repair and maintenance projects efficiently.
### Public Safety:

Accident Prevention: Timely identification of potholes and cracks can contribute to accident prevention by addressing potential hazards on the road, improving overall public safety.
Smart Cities:

### Traffic Management:
 Integrating the model with smart city infrastructure can enhance traffic management systems by providing real-time information on road conditions and potential obstacles.
### Asset Management:

Long-Term Planning: The model's insights can assist in long-term asset management by predicting the lifespan of road surfaces, aiding in budget allocation and resource planning.
